I never talked to you.. <br>I just randomly started flirting with you cause your outfit was cute..<br> I just went with the flow and how you replied and your anxious messages about what to do where cute.. <br> I thought you kinda have many qualities I would love in a girl.. I trusted my heart and just proposed to you..<br> I mean that could be really weird.. but I didn't expect you would take some time and see if you like me and my behaviour.. <br><br>And so I waited and also talked to you more to know you more..</p>
